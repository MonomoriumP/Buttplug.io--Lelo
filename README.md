# Buttplug.io to Lelo
An ESP32 remote control to send Buttplug.io commands to a Lelo toy.

Based on the remote control developed by Scanlime (more details here https://scanlime.org/2012/11/hacking-my-vagina/), it uses an ESP32 to emulate a Lovense bluetooth toy that Buttplug.io can recognize.

The original library developed by Scanlime (https://github.com/scanlime/arduino-lelo-remote) does not work without commenting //#include <avr/pgmspace.h>. I put the library in this repository if necessary.
